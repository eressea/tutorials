# Aquarian Tutorial

## Explanation of Choices
----------------------
*I'll skip the technical details, the WIKI answers your questions, otherwise the Goblin's tutorial is a model of its kind.*

The Aquarian is a race very close to humans, but specialized in sailing and trade.
The Aquarian is an entertainer race. It can quickly generate an economy thanks to this skill.
Although they have no penalty in combat and weaponsmithing, they prove to be much less effective than "combat" races like orcs, dwarves or demons.
A combat-oriented Aquarian from the start will pose problems even to these races but will struggle to emerge victorious.

Why? 
To make weapons you need to be at least level 2. That means between 2 and 4 turns for the Aquarian (1 turn for combat races). Need to train several Aquarians to produce more than one weapon per turn (1 weapon/turn is useless).
The Aquarian has a penalty in mining (-2), so it has no choice at the beginning but to use wood, wood that is also essential for ships.
So, either the Aquarian puts all its energy into making fighters (first a front line of spearmen and cavalry to protect the mages then a second line), or it sails and creates an economy.
Its special ability in sailing won't really be used if it opts for survival through weapons, so you might as well play a human who has fewer penalties.
If you choose to do cartography then there's not a stick of wood to put into weapons, at least at the start.

Whatever the case, in the long term, the Aquarian's survival lies more in its ability to settle on other islands, to quickly make contacts and find alliances. Proving its clear superiority in cartography can allow it to position itself as indispensable to its neighbors. It must not give away its maps, they are its survival currency.
It has no penalty in magic, and the choice of its school is important. It will determine its ability to defend itself quickly or its usefulness in an alliance in the long term.
The Gwyrrd school gives advantages in sailing from level 4 and brings combat spells at level 3 (between 3 and 9 turns of Learn).
The Draig school offers a combat spell from level 2.
Read the spells of the different schools carefully and make your choice, but Gwyrrd is a choice you'll never regret as an Aquarian.

Here I will present the development of an Aquarian faction oriented on sailing, cartography, trade and espionage.
The idea will be to quickly create an economy thanks to entertainment, to train mages who will also contribute to the economy but also to defense, and to send the maximum number of ships towards the unknown.
This is a very risky starting bet as it will depend on your neighbors and their ability to project into the future and know how to trust.
But at least it will allow you to have fun and meet many players!

For a more warrior/defense start, take inspiration from the human start with a few exceptions, and add a touch of sailing.
