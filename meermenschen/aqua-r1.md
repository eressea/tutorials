# Aqua Turn 1

## Discovery of locations:
Starting on a wooded plain, surrounded by 2 swamps and the ocean.
Resources: 500 wood, 100 saplings, 51 horses, 4004 peasants.
General starting endowment: 2500 silver, 4 stones, 10 wood.
Aquarian starting endowment: 1 boat, 1 captain.
Classic start, but with many horses (that's very good).
With our recruitments the max trade will decrease from next week in this region.
The horses will be useful for trade, transport and exploration of the island.
The 2 nearby regions are swamps, that's not great but it could be worse. We will need to settle there in the future at least for the first trade.

## Recruitment
Recruit our 5 mages (COMBAT status Defensive)
Recruit 1 unit with perception, who will learn perception EVERY turn.
Recruit our shipcraft (more is useless at the start)
Recruit our 2nd captain
Recruit our entertainers (COMBAT status Aggressive, they must protect the mages)
Recruit our pilot assistant (entertainment)
Recruit our future pilot's assistant (entertainment) (COMBAT NOT)
Send the first boat far away. (COMBAT NOT)

## First turn particularity:
Name (or renumber) your Faction. This is important especially for your neighbors. An unnamed faction is quickly considered suspicious or unfriendly. How to address the player of the "Faction uv9t" tribe?
Name all your units, even describe them.
Name your buildings, here the boat, it's more pleasant!

## Attention!
The first unit is in the boat. Any unit recruited by it will be in the boat. So all units recruited this turn, except the pilot assistant must leave the boat!
Otherwise your boat will be "overloaded" and won't be able to sail. You must also give away all the material or the boat will be overloaded.

Recruit the 5 mages even if it's an investment, because each mage costs 80+100+10=190 silver. Each level 1 mage can cast a spell to earn 50 silver. So if all goes well a mage pays for itself very quickly. A mage can have failures but the risk is worth it, especially since the entertainers will ensure survival in case of problems.

Recruit one unit in perception to avoid being an easy target for thieves.

Only one shipcraft recruited because you can't enter an unbuilt boat. So building a boat in 1 turn is useless at the start because we lack resources.

It's preferable to send a boat with 2 units: 1 captain and an entertainer. As an Aquarian if you don't give long orders you can Work at sea, so cost nothing. However, as soon as you land you can bring back money (except guarded case). You can also swim to the coast for the first contact.

Don't forget to give money to the boat captain! Here I give a lot (everything that remains).
I also create a special group for the navigators so they won't starve feeding foreign passengers.

## Navigation technique and choice:
Coastal sailing or heading for open sea. This is a choice to make according to the apparent configuration of the island.
Here we are at the end of an island. We can easily coast to explore the island and meet its inhabitants. On the other hand, coastal sailing is long and tedious, and allows discovering fewer regions.
So I will opt for a first open sea departure and coastal sailing with the second boat.
A boat cannot go directly from mainland to mainland. So to minimize risks during coastal sailing, take to the open sea even if it's a bit longer.
