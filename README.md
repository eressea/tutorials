# Eressea Tutorial 2024

These are the diaries for the 2024 Eressea Tutorial. 

## How to add your diary

### Create your own fork of the repository

- Create a github account.

- Fork this repository by clicking on the [Fork Link in Github](https://github.com/eressea/tutorials/fork). This will create your private copy of the whole thing.

### Editing your content

- You can edit it directly on github or *clone* it to your computer and edit it there. Cloning requires more steps, but is ultimately more flexible. It requires you to learn a bit about version control with [git](https://git-scm.com/docs/gittutorial) and [github](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/hello-world)

- Create a subdirectory for your faction, for example 'dragonborn'.

- Copy the file called 'index.njk' from the 'template' directory into your subdirectory:

```
---
layout: base-layout.njk
title: Not Goblins!
override:tags: ["race"]
pagination:
  data: collections.nogoblin
  size: 8
  reverse: false
  alias: posts
---
{% for post in posts %}
...
```

Change the title as you wish.

- If you want to create just one big file, replace everything below the second '---' with your content. This is not recommended if you want to add a lot of text. The content is [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/), a text file format that let's you add basic formatting like headings, links, images. You could also use html directly. Then you would create an index.html file instead. HTML is less recommended.

- If you have more to say, you should split your diary into multiple files. In that case, leave everything below the '---' as it is, at least for now. Also copy 'Auswertung_XX.md' from the template directory into your subdirectory. You may rename them as you wish, for example to week_01.md, week_02.md, ... and so forth.

- Also copy the file nogoblins.json to your directory and rename it to yourdirectory.json.
```
{
    "author": "enno",
    "layout": "post-layout.njk",
    "tags": "nogoblin"
}
```
- Change the author to your name and "nogoblin" to "your_race".

- Edit every Auswertung_XX.md:
```
---
title: "Dragonborn: Round 1"
date: 2024-03-17
---
# Round 1
 Lore ipsum ...
## Heading 1

...
```

This file consists of the 'front matter' between the lines starting with '---'. It contains some meta data that will be used for presenting your files nicely.

- Change the title
- Change the date line. The files will be ordered by the 'date' field, so make sure to get that right.
- Write your text below the second '---' line

- If you're editing directly in github, 'commit' your changes using the github interface. You can commit directly to your 'main' branch.


### Seeing your content

- If you have cloned your repository and are using a Linux system, you can run 
```
npm install
npm run serve
```
in a terminal. Watch the terminal for error messages. If all went well, you can then see the generated pages at [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) (your port may vary).


### Uploading your content

- If you have cloned the repository to your computer, you must ['add'](https://git-scm.com/docs/gittutorial)  and ['commit'](https://git-scm.com/docs/gittutorial) your changes, then 'push' them to your repository.

- Optional: Activate github actions and github-pages. TODO

- If you have pushed your changes or commited them on github and you are happy with them, create a ['pull request'](https://github.blog/developer-skills/github/beginners-guide-to-github-creating-a-pull-request/) for the actual eressea repository (sometimes called the 'upstream repository'). If you have changes, you should see a line like "This branch is 1 commit ahead of eressea/tutorials:main' on github. Use the 'contribute' button to 'Open a pull request'. Write a short comment explaining your changes and 'Create pull request'. This will notifiy the owners of the upstream repo to review your changes. If they like them, they will 'merge' them and they can be watched online. They may also have comments or questions or ask you for changes before actually merging them.



### Done!
